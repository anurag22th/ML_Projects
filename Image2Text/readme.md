This is a project which uses a tesseract-ocr to convert the text in an image and text in an image inside image to text.
The pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = 'C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe' helps with tesseract/pytesseract not detected error.
Do add Tesseract-OCR to path in environment variables.
